# What it does
The application has several features for two major categories of users. Using OpenWeatherMap API, the user can know what clothes to wear based on the temperature outside, to be better prepared for the environment.
The most important feature is for those affected by homelessness. The website includes a detailed description of the issue, information about the major organization working towards the issue, and the locations where the needy can get help from.
# Inspiration
During my visits to the city's downtown area, I witnessed the appalling conditions of the homeless this winter. I researched about the same and found out that there are several Non-profit organizations and sheltered homes built specifically for them. Then why are they still out there? I wondered if this problem was genuinely unsolvable.
After hours of brainstorming, I came up with a catalyst for the solutions already implemented by the government. I compiled a list of 40+ such organizations across North America for them to have access to it using Google Maps API. This also serves as a medium through which users can check out the website and learn more about the cause.
# How we built it
This application is made using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript majorly, and it is made as a Web Application to communicate with the maximum number of users possible, irrespective of their economic status.
# Challenges we ran into
Initially, the plan was to make a simple website with all the content used. But as I wanted to make this as user-friendly as possible, a new approach came to action and was ultimately done on time.
# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Learning new functions using CSS  has been my new learning and a major leap from my previous projects, which I am immensely proud of.
# What we learned
I learned to see the issue of homelessness from an entirely new perspective and realized how the treatment of the affected can be improved.
# What's next for Cozi
More locations will be added and ultimately the website will be spread as much to help those affected by homelessness and spread awareness about the same.
